🧾 Incident Report

Incident Title:

Outbound LDAP Connection to External Microsoft IP (Port 389)

Incident ID:

SOC-2025-10-07-001

Reported Date/Time:

2025-10-07, 04:30 AM (UTC)

Reported By:

[Your Name / SOC Monitoring System]

Severity:

Low

⸻

1. Summary

An alert was triggered by the security monitoring system indicating that a workstation established an outbound connection to an external IP address over port 389 (LDAP).
Since LDAP is generally used for internal Active Directory communication, such outbound activity was reviewed for potential data exfiltration, misconfiguration, or compromise.

2. Detection Details

Field	Details
Alert Name	Outbound LDAP Connection to External Host
Detection Source	Firewall / Network IDS
Source Host	[Hostname / IP of workstation]
Destination IP	[External Microsoft IP Address]
Destination Port	389 (LDAP)
Detection Time	2025-10-07 04:30 AM
Bytes Out	0
Bytes In	260 bytes, 70 bytes (two short events)
Number of Events	2
Reputation Check	Clean (Microsoft Corporation – ASN AS8075)
Running Processes	osquery.exe, ServiceNow agent


⸻

3. Investigation Steps
	1.	Verified IP ownership using WHOIS and ASN lookup tools.
	•	Result: IP belongs to Microsoft Corporation (AS8075), reputable and widely recognized.
	2.	Reviewed process activity on the host around the event timestamp.
	•	Only osquery and ServiceNow agent processes were active.
	•	No PowerShell, cmd, VBS, or suspicious binaries observed.
	3.	Reviewed firewall logs.
	•	Outbound session initiated, but no payload bytes transmitted (0 bytes out).
	•	Only small inbound responses received (260B, 70B).
	•	Total of 2 connection attempts observed.
	4.	Checked DNS and reputation.
	•	DNS resolution mapped to a valid Microsoft domain range.
	•	No malicious or suspicious reputation from VirusTotal, Talos, or AbuseIPDB.
	5.	Validated EDR telemetry (if available).
	•	No suspicious behavior, privilege escalation, or process injection detected.

4. Findings

Observation	Analysis
External IP owned by Microsoft (AS8075)	✅ Legitimate vendor infrastructure
Connection on LDAP port (389)	⚠️ Unusual for external destination, may indicate misconfiguration
No outbound data	✅ No sign of data exfiltration or credential leak
Processes active: osquery, ServiceNow agent	✅ Trusted enterprise agents
Connection frequency: 2 times only	✅ Non-persistent behavior
IP reputation	✅ Clean and widely used for Microsoft services

🔍 Additional Observations

Only Two Short Events
	•	Very short-lived, non-persistent activity.
	•	If it were malicious (data exfiltration, tunneling, or credential leak), you’d expect many repeated connections and significant bidirectional byte transfer.

Normal Processes at the Time
	•	osquery and ServiceNow agent both make outbound checks to Microsoft cloud and internal endpoints.
	•	It’s plausible one of them triggered a lookup, telemetry check, or even a mis-targeted LDAP ping (e.g., a library trying to query AD information that defaulted to a public resolver).

Assessment:
The connection was short-lived, transmitted no outbound data, and was directed to a legitimate Microsoft network. This behavior aligns with benign or misconfigured agent behavior, possibly resulting from:
	•	An osquery or ServiceNow module briefly attempting to reach Microsoft services or perform an external directory test.
	•	A Windows component performing a one-time telemetry or connectivity check.

⸻

5. Conclusion

This event is classified as a False Positive / Benign Network Activity.
There are no indicators of compromise, no data exfiltration, and no evidence of malicious intent.

The most probable cause is a legitimate agent (osquery or ServiceNow) generating a transient LDAP query or telemetry check that reached a Microsoft-owned IP over port 389.

⸻

6. Recommendations

Recommendation	Purpose
Restrict outbound LDAP (port 389) at perimeter firewalls.	Prevent any accidental or malicious LDAP traffic to the Internet.
Allow only internal LDAP/LDAPS (389/636) to known internal domain controllers.	Enforce secure and expected directory communications.
Review osquery / ServiceNow configurations.	Ensure no external LDAP lookups or misconfigured plugins exist.
Continue monitoring for recurrence.	Validate if similar outbound attempts appear again.
Document this as a known benign event.	Reduce noise in future correlation or SIEM rules.
