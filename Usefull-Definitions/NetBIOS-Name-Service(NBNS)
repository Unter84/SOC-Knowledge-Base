## 🔹 What is NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS)?

* **NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)** is an old Windows protocol (from the 1980s–90s).
* It was used for **local network communication** before DNS was widely adopted.
* **NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS)** runs on UDP port **137** and is used to:

  * Resolve machine names to IP addresses in a **LAN** (local area network).
  * Example: Your PC wants to find `HR-PC` → it broadcasts an NBNS query → HR-PC responds with its IP.

✅ Today, NBNS is **mostly legacy**, replaced by DNS. But Windows systems still generate it sometimes (especially for file sharing / SMB).

## 🔹 What Does “Host Tried NBNS to the Internet” Mean?

* Normally, NBNS queries should **stay inside your local network**.
* If you see them going **out to the internet**, it means:

  * A machine is asking *“Who is HR-PC?”* and accidentally sending that request to an external IP.
  * This is usually **not intended** — it leaks internal hostnames/domain names.

---

## 🔹 Why Is This a Problem?

1. **Information Leakage**

   * Your internal machine names (`HR-PC`, `FINANCE-SRV1`, `DC01`) could be exposed to external servers.
   * Attackers can learn your **internal naming convention**, Active Directory domain name, or even usernames.

2. **Exploitation (NBNS Poisoning)**

   * Attackers can set up a rogue NBNS responder on the internet.
   * Your host sends `Who is FILESERVER?` → attacker replies “That’s me!” → your host might try to authenticate → sends NTLM credentials.
   * This leads to **credential theft / relay attacks** (MITRE ATT\&CK T1557.001 – LLMNR/NBNS Poisoning).

3. **Malware Behavior**

   * Some malware uses NBNS/WINS lookups as part of **reconnaissance** or **C2 communication fallback**.
   * Seeing NBNS go outbound is sometimes a sign of infection.

## 🔹 Example Scenario

* **Normal (inside LAN):**

  * Your laptop: “Who is HR-PC?” → HR-PC replies with its IP → connection works.

* **Abnormal (to internet):**

  * Your laptop: “Who is FILESERVER?” → query accidentally sent to `8.8.8.8` or an attacker’s server.
  * Attacker: “I’m FILESERVER” → laptop sends NTLM auth → attacker now has password hash.

---

## 🔹 SOC Perspective

* **Benign but risky:** Misconfigurations where Windows falls back to NBNS/LLMNR when DNS fails, and the query leaks out.
* **Suspicious:** Large volume of NBNS outbound → scanning, malware beaconing.
* **Dangerous:** NBNS responses from external IPs → could mean **credential theft attack in progress**.

---

## 🔹 What to Do

1. **Contain**

   * Block NBNS (UDP/137) traffic to the internet at firewall.
   * It should never leave the LAN.

2. **Investigate**

   * Which host generated it?
   * Was it one-off (misconfig) or persistent (malware)?

3. **Mitigate**

   * Disable **LLMNR/NBNS** in Windows via Group Policy if not needed.
   * Enforce DNS only for name resolution.
   * Monitor for NTLM authentication attempts to external servers.

---

✅ **In short:**
“**Host tried NetBIOS Name Service to the internet**” = a Windows machine attempted to use the old NBNS protocol (UDP/137) to resolve names, but instead of keeping it inside the LAN, it went out to the internet.

* Normally harmless misconfig,
* But can leak hostnames and even credentials,
* And can be exploited by attackers via **NBNS poisoning**.
