# üõ°Ô∏è Playbook: DCSync Attack Detected

**Filename:** `playbook-dcsync-attack-detected.md`  
**Category:** Active Directory / Credential Access  
**Use Case:** Investigating alerts triggered by unauthorized Directory Replication Service (DRS) requests (commonly used in DCSync attacks).

---

## üéØ Alert Context ‚Äî Why this matters
- **DCSync** is an adversary technique where a system impersonates a Domain Controller (DC) and requests password replication using DRS protocols.  
- **Impact:** Exposes NTLM hashes, Kerberos keys, and even the KRBTGT account ‚Üí enables Golden Tickets, Pass-the-Hash, and domain compromise.  
- **Risk Level:** Critical.  

**Relevant Detection Sources:**
- Windows Security Logs (Event ID 4662, 4673, 4742)  
- Directory Service logs (Event IDs 4928, 4929 ‚Äì replication requests)  
- EDR/XDR detections of Mimikatz, DCSync modules  
- Network logs for unusual LDAP/DRSR traffic

## üß≠ Analyst Actions (L1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí L3)

### L1 ‚Äî Initial Triage
- ‚úÖ Capture alert details: account, source IP/hostname, target DC, timestamp.  
- ‚úÖ Verify whether account used is **Domain Admin, Enterprise Admin, or a DC computer account**.  
- ‚úÖ If **non-DC account** was used ‚Üí suspicious.  
- ‚úÖ Check source host ‚Äî must be a DC for legitimate replication.  
- üö© Escalate to L2 if:
  - Account is not a DC or highly privileged account.  
  - Source is a workstation or non-DC server.  
  - Alert occurred outside expected change/test windows.  

**SPL ‚Äî Detect DCSync Events**
```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=4662
| search ObjectType="DS-Replication-Get-Changes*" 
| table _time ComputerName SubjectUserName SubjectDomainName ObjectType AccessMask

L2 ‚Äî Deep Investigation

1. Account Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Identify which account requested replication.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm if it‚Äôs an expected privileged account or service.

index=wineventlog EventCode=4662
| stats count by SubjectUserName ObjectType AccessMask ComputerName

2. Source Host Verification
	‚Ä¢	Check whether the request originated from a legitimate DC.

index=wineventlog EventCode=4624
| search TargetUserName=<SuspiciousAccount>
| table _time IpAddress WorkstationName LogonType AuthenticationPackageName

3. Timeline Reconstruction
	‚Ä¢	Look for process creation linked to Mimikatz or PowerShell DCSync modules.

index=sysmon EventCode=1 host=<HOST>
| search CommandLine="*lsadump::dcsync*" OR CommandLine="*mimikatz*"
| table _time Image CommandLine ParentImage User

4. Directory Service Events
	‚Ä¢	Check Event IDs 4928/4929 (replication requests added/removed).

index=wineventlog EventCode=4928 OR EventCode=4929
| table _time ComputerName SubjectUserName ServicePrincipalName

5. Threat Intel
	‚Ä¢	Enrich source IP and file hashes (if applicable) with VirusTotal / OTX / MISP.

L3 ‚Äî Confirm & Respond

Containment
	‚Ä¢	Isolate the source host immediately.
	‚Ä¢	Disable or suspend the account used.

Eradication
	‚Ä¢	Investigate for credential dumping tools (Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike).
	‚Ä¢	Collect memory and forensic artifacts.
	‚Ä¢	Remove persistence mechanisms.

Recovery
	‚Ä¢	Reset credentials for Domain Admins and service accounts used on the host.
	‚Ä¢	Reset KRBTGT account password twice to invalidate forged tickets.
	‚Ä¢	Harden replication permissions to restrict to DC accounts only.

If False Positive:
	‚Ä¢	Some identity sync tools or backup agents may perform legitimate replication.
	‚Ä¢	Verify with infra/identity team.
	‚Ä¢	Document in allowlist if expected.

üìù Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Template

1) Executive Summary
	‚Ä¢	What happened: DCSync attempt detected from <HOST> using <ACCOUNT>.
	‚Ä¢	Impact: Potential theft of domain credential hashes.
	‚Ä¢	Disposition: <True Positive | False Positive>.

2) Timeline
	‚Ä¢	T0: DCSync alert triggered.
	‚Ä¢	T1: Account and source host reviewed.
	‚Ä¢	T2: Process and logon events correlated.
	‚Ä¢	T3: Containment & remediation executed.

3) Root Cause
	‚Ä¢	[Compromised privileged account | Unauthorized replication | Misconfigured service account | Legitimate replication activity].

4) Scope
	‚Ä¢	Accounts queried, DCs targeted, any lateral movement indicators.

5) Actions Taken
	‚Ä¢	Containment, account disablement, forensic review, password resets.

6) Preventive Measures
	‚Ä¢	Restrict replication rights to DC accounts only.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor for 4662 events with DS-Replication permissions.
	‚Ä¢	Implement Just-In-Time Admin for privileged accounts.

7) Lessons Learned
	‚Ä¢	Improve SIEM rules for correlation.
	‚Ä¢	Validate inventory of accounts with replication rights.

‚∏ª

üõ° Recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Immediate
	‚Ä¢	Isolate suspicious source host.
	‚Ä¢	Disable compromised account.
	‚Ä¢	Reset KRBTGT account (twice).
	‚Ä¢	Hardening
	‚Ä¢	Remove replication rights from non-DC accounts.
	‚Ä¢	Use Microsoft Protected Users group.
	‚Ä¢	Enforce LSASS protection (RunAsPPL).
	‚Ä¢	Apply tiered admin model.
	‚Ä¢	Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Alert on Event ID 4662 with ObjectType = DS-Replication-Get-Changes* where SubjectUserName ‚â† DC account.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor for suspicious PowerShell/Mimikatz usage.
	‚Ä¢	Watch for unusual LDAP/DRSR traffic patterns.

‚∏ª

üìé Before Escalating to Customer

Provide:
	‚Ä¢	Account and host that initiated replication.
	‚Ä¢	Target DC(s).
	‚Ä¢	Evidence (Event IDs 4662, 4928/4929).
	‚Ä¢	Process/logon correlation (e.g., Mimikatz).
	‚Ä¢	Risk statement (potential domain compromise).
	‚Ä¢	Containment & remediation steps taken.
