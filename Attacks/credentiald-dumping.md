ðŸ“Œ Credential Dumping â€“ Deep Dive

ðŸ”¹ What is Credential Dumping?

Credential dumping is a post-exploitation technique used by attackers to extract authentication secrets (like usernames, passwords, hashes, Kerberos tickets, or plaintext credentials) from compromised systems.

The goal: gain persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally across the environment.

Attackers donâ€™t always need passwords in plaintext â€” sometimes a hash or ticket is enough (for Pass-the-Hash or Pass-the-Ticket attacks).

ðŸ”¹ Why Attackers Use It
	â€¢	Bypass authentication (reuse or crack credentials).
	â€¢	Escalate privileges (dumping local admin or domain admin credentials).
	â€¢	Lateral movement (access file shares, RDP, VPN, cloud services).
	â€¢	Establish long-term persistence (backdoors, domain dominance).

ðŸ”¹ Techniques & Methods of Credential Dumping

Attackers use different methods depending on the system (Windows, Linux, macOS, cloud).

1. Windows Credential Dumping
	â€¢	LSASS Process Memory (most common target):
	â€¢	Tools: Mimikatz, ProcDump, comsvcs.dll
	â€¢	Extracts plaintext passwords, hashes, Kerberos tickets from lsass.exe.
	â€¢	SAM Database (Security Accounts Manager):
	â€¢	Stored in C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM.
	â€¢	Contains local user password hashes.
	â€¢	Access requires SYSTEM-level privileges.
	â€¢	NTDS.dit (Active Directory Database):
	â€¢	Located on Domain Controllers.
	â€¢	Contains all domain usersâ€™ credentials (hashes).
	â€¢	Tools: ntdsutil, secretsdump.py (Impacket).
	â€¢	DCSync Attack:
	â€¢	Abuse of Directory Replication Service (DRSUAPI) to request password hashes from DCs.
	â€¢	Doesnâ€™t require direct file access.
	â€¢	WDigest & Cached Credentials:
	â€¢	If enabled, stores plaintext passwords in memory.
	â€¢	LSA Secrets:
	â€¢	Registry-stored credentials for services or scheduled tasks.

2. Linux Credential Dumping
	â€¢	/etc/passwd & /etc/shadow files:
	â€¢	Contain hashed credentials.
	â€¢	Often exfiltrated for offline cracking.
	â€¢	Credential caches:
	â€¢	SSH private keys, Kerberos tickets (/tmp/krb5cc_*).
	â€¢	Memory scraping:
	â€¢	Tools like gcore, proc filesystem dumps.

3. Cloud Credential Dumping
	â€¢	AWS / Azure / GCP metadata services abuse: extract temporary credentials.
	â€¢	Credential files on endpoints (AWS CLI credentials, Azure auth tokens).
	â€¢	OAuth tokens & browser credential stores (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

ðŸ”¹ Tools Commonly Used
	â€¢	Mimikatz (Windows â€“ plaintext, hashes, tickets).
	â€¢	Impacketâ€™s secretsdump.py (NTDS, SAM, LSASS).
	â€¢	LaZagne (extracts passwords from apps/browsers).
	â€¢	ProcDump (dump LSASS memory).
	â€¢	Windows Credential Editor (WCE).
	â€¢	Gsecdump.

ðŸ”¹ Real-World Incidents Involving Credential Dumping
	1.	NotPetya (2017)
	â€¢	Spread rapidly using stolen admin credentials after dumping from LSASS.
	â€¢	Report: US-CERT Alert on NotPetya
	2.	SolarWinds / SUNBURST (2020)
	â€¢	Attackers used credential dumping to escalate privileges and access Microsoft 365/Azure AD.
	â€¢	Report: CISA Analysis Report
	3.	FIN7 (Carbanak Group)
	â€¢	Extensively used Mimikatz to steal Windows credentials from retail and hospitality targets.
	â€¢	Report: FireEye on FIN7
	4.	Equation Group (Linked to NSA leaks)
	â€¢	Used DCSync attacks and LSASS dumping.
	â€¢	Report: Wiki on Equation Group
	5.	APT29 (Cozy Bear)
	â€¢	Used credential dumping in campaigns targeting COVID-19 vaccine research.
	â€¢	Report: UK NCSC Advisory
