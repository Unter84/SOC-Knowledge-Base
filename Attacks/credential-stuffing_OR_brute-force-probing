# ðŸ”¹ What is Credential Stuffing?

* **Credential stuffing** = When attackers take **real usernames and passwords** stolen from one website (like a past data breach) and **reuse them** to try logging into other websites.
* Why it works: Many people **reuse the same password** across multiple accounts.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

* A hacker steals a list of email + password combos from a leaked shopping site.
* One of them is: `alice@email.com / MySecret123`.
* The attacker tries that same login on Gmail, Facebook, Office 365, or your companyâ€™s VPN.
* If Alice reused her password, the hacker gets in **without even guessing**.

# ðŸ”¹ What is Brute-Force Probing?

* **Brute-force probing** = When attackers **guess passwords repeatedly** until they find the right one.
* They donâ€™t use stolen passwords â€” they just try many combinations.
* This can be simple (guessing common ones like `Password123`) or advanced (using tools to try millions of possibilities).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

* An attacker wants to break into Bobâ€™s company account (`bob@company.com`).
* They try:

  * `bob123`
  * `Welcome1`
  * `Company2025!`
  * and so onâ€¦
* Or they use a tool that runs thousands of guesses per minute until one works.

# ðŸ”¹ Key Difference

* **Credential Stuffing** â†’ Tries **known real passwords** from breaches.
* **Brute Force** â†’ Tries **guesses** (random or common).

# ðŸ”¹ Real-World Analogy

Imagine you have one key for your house.

* **Credential Stuffing**: A thief finds your lost house key and tries it on **other houses** in the neighborhood â€” and it opens one because someone used the same lock.
* **Brute Force**: The thief has a giant keyring with **millions of keys** and keeps trying until one opens your door.

# ðŸ”¹ Why it Matters for SOC

* Both attacks show up as **multiple failed login attempts** in logs.
* Detection often involves:

  * Spotting repeated failed logins from the same IP.
  * Or seeing one IP trying lots of usernames (brute force).
  * Or many IPs trying one username (credential stuffing via botnets).

---

âœ… **In short:**

* Credential stuffing = using **already known stolen passwords**.
* Brute force = **guessing passwords** until success.
