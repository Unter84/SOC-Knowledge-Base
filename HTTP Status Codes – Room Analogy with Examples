Think of the internet as a giant hotel. Every URL is like a room inside that hotel. When your browser (the guest) knocks on the door (sends a request), the server (hotel staff) answers with a status code — telling you what’s going on with that room.

 	• 1xx (Informational): The staff hears your knock and says, “Hold on, I’m checking”.
	•	2xx (Success): The staff opens the door and lets you in — everything went fine.
	•	3xx (Redirection): The staff says, “This room has moved, try that other door instead.”
	•	4xx (Client Error): You (the guest) did something wrong — wrong door, no key, or you’re not allowed in.
	•	5xx (Server Error): The hotel staff messed up — the room is broken, under repair, or they can’t serve you right now.

By mapping codes to hotel room situations, we can better understand what servers are telling us when browsing the web.
